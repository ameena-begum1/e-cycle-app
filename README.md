# ‡§à-Cycle 
**Redefining Devices, Reviving Possibilities**

## üí° Introduction

**Problem Statement**: The growing pile-up of unused electronic devices poses serious environmental challenges. E-Cycle tackles this issue by encouraging responsible actions: repair, reuse, recycle, and donation, while creating an inclusive platform that empowers users and supports a circular economy.


**Solution**: E-Cycle connects users looking to buy, sell, repair, recycle, or donate electronic devices. With smart features like AI-powered price comparison, technician booking, and government-verified recycling centers integrated through the EPR portal, our app ensures every device is handled with purpose. Whether it's giving a phone a second life or responsibly recycling a broken one, E-Cycle makes every action count.

A **Google Solution Challenge Project'25** Organised By Google Developer Group Project by **Team Triwizard From Muffakham Jah College Of Engineering and Technology**
